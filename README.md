# Programming Question


**Problem Statement:**

Design and implement a singly linked list in C++ to manage student records. 
Each student has:
  1. id
  2. name
  3. gpa
  4. List of courses enrolled - 

Use appropriate type for these attributes. 

Each course has:
  1. Course name
  2. Location
     
Your dr should support the following operations:
  1. Insert a student at the end of the list.
  2. Delete a student by id.
  3. Search for a student by id and display their details. (should include list of all the courses taken)
  4. Display all students in the list.
  5. Count the number of students in the list.
  6. Add a course to Student.
     
Requirements:
  1. Do not use std::list or other STL containers. Implement the linked list manually using pointers.

  2. Create a Node structure to represent each student.
  
  3. Write a LinkedList class that implements the required operations.
  
  4. In main(), present a menu-driven program to let the user test the functions.
  5. Make sure to name your Student class files as Student.cpp/hpp and Course class as Course.cpp/hpp (note S and C are uppercase) and the file that has main() function as driver.cpp

  ## Sample Output:
  ```
1. Insert Student
2. Delete Student
3. Search Student
4. Display All
5. Count Students
6. Add a course
7. Exit

Make sure to run several tests to ensure your code is tested properly for all edge cases.

Scoring:
  - 10 points: Program compiles and runs properly for at least one test case. 
  - 5 points: Test coverage - Make sure to indicate what scenario you are trying to test for each test case. - Upload to Canvas test results
  - 5 points: Ask the same question to chatGPT. Compare your implementation with chatGPT response and give at least 5 differences between your implementation and chatGPT implementation.
